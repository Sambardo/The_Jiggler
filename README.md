# The Jiggler
This is a PowerShell Script I use occasionally to prevent my lock screen from coming up. 

My oculus virtual desktop kept disconnecting every 30-60m when the lock screen would come down. 
When it happened I often had to crash and relaunch the games instead of being able to reconnect. 

It presses F15 every 6 minutes. 

I might add a GUI later for funsies. 

This is useful if you want to add alt/shift/ctrl
